# Connected Vehicles Application - Alten Challange
Introduction
It is required to design and implement vehicle connectivity monitoring dashboard platform. There are a number of connected vehicles that belongs to a number of customers and it is needed to view the status of the connection for these vehicles on a monitoring display. The vehicles send the status of the connection - ping/heartbeat - one time per minute. If the heartbeat was not received by the vehicle for more than 1 minute, it means no connection.

Requirements
Web GUI (Single Page Application Framework/Platform).

An overview of all vehicles should be visible on one page (full-screen display), together with their status.

It should be able to filter, to only show vehicles for a specific customer.

It should be able to filter, to only show vehicles that have a specific status.

Random simulation to vehicles status sending.

If database design will consume a lot of time, use data in-memory representation.

Unit Testing.

.NET Core, Java or any native language.

Complete analysis for the problem.

Full architectural sketch to solution.

Analysis behind the solution design, technologies,....

How the solution will make use of cloud.

Deployment steps.
